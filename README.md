## The Password lists are collected from [Seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

- The program doesn't tell the safety or the strength of the password, it simply verify if the password has been breached or not

If the Checker has very small leaked password lists its yet to get updated.This is just an simple program just looking over text,for better results you can visit [HaveIbeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com).I will try to update the password list, frequently.
